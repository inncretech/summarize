 Overall, the Trekko is a great stroller. I like the sun canopy and the ease of going over different types of terrain. The infant seat enclosure is a nice touch and the recline is easy. There are a couple of things I wish the stroller had, and one issue with a wobbling wheel, which I demonstrate to you in this video review.

It was the right price for me.  I am a casual jogger and didn't need a BOB for what the BOBs cost.  My 2yo daughter loves it.  We have multiple strollers and she always requests this one.  The canopy is great.  It shields from sun and wind and there is a eek a boo window that I love.  The wheels are extremely sturdy.  They go smoothly over gravel and large rocks.  I live in a desert climate so the surfaces are not smooth, but this stroller feels like they are.  It fits into the trunk of my Toyota Corolla.  You can easily fix the wheel in front to go straight only or to swivel.  It's just a push of a button.  The basket is huge.

On my second or third outing, while I was actually jogging, the front wheel began to wobble.  No problem, I just detached it, turned it around, and re-attached it.  No more wobbling after that.  Now any time it happens, about once every five times, I take the front wheel off, turn it 180 degrees, then reattach it and that stops the wobbling for good.  I'm really impressed because I read SO many complaints about jogging strollers wobbling, and I thought it was a curse of any jogging stroller under $300.

I love that I can use this again with the next baby because it accepts Graco car seats.

Problem one, this monster is quite heavy.  But that is typical for joggers.  I don't have any trouble with it because it's extremely easy to fold and unfold, but it is not practical for light use.  That is why I am going to replace my now-broken umbrella stroller with a Graco Liteway.  My daughter and I use our strollers an awful lot so I need the two. This is not the stroller I choose to keep in my trunk for trips to the mall, or for the walk to daycare.  It is just too bulky.  I prefer to keep it in the garage and use it for long walks with the dog in our neighborhood and the occasional jog.  It's wonderful for that.  I can steer it with one hand while I play with my phone.

Another problem is that if I put too much stuff in the basket, it detaches.  No problem, it's easy to fix.  But I didn't want to carry my purse.  My purse was really heavy that day.  It had my work laptop in it.  So I will be purchasing a stroller hook for that.

Also I'm bummed that it doesn't have a snack tray for my daughter.  I bought a detachable cup holder for her, but I don't really like it because it doesn't stay in place.  The only thing I would change about this stroller is that I would add a snack tray.

So for the price I give this 5 stars.  I paid about 145 for it.  Had I spent 200 or more I would have given it four stars for not having a snack tray for baby.  Other than that it's pretty great for jogging and/or long walks.

7 of 7 people found the following review helpful                       5.0 out of 5 stars             Perfect competition for a BOB and for active families, December 30, 2011                        By&nbsp;Daniel J. Letourneau  (CHAMPLIN, MN, US)  - See all my reviews                       This review is from:  Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis (Baby Product)         We had purchased a standard Graco travel system and after a couple of uses on nonpaved trails, we decided to purchase a B.O.B. stroller from REI. Darn things are spendy! Luckily, just prior to purchasing it, we found this Trekko on the Graco UK site and it was now being carried by Target. At 1/3 to 2/3 the price of a B.O.B we could make it work.

Positives:
-Snug ride 35 fits into it perfectly and has lots of sunshade protection.
-Nice wide stable platform for hiking trails and rough ground.
-Not some funky weird color that will be dated looking next week.
-Large basket that supports a pretty good amount of weight.
-PLENTY of air circulation for hot weather.
-One foot locking that is actually sturdy
-Long enough from handle to rear tires that tall people will not always be hitting it with their feet.

Negatives:
-Could stand to have the basket latch redesigned to lock firmer and have both sides lock (sometimes only one side locks into place)
-Moveable backrest could also stand to have a latch redesign for the same reasons above
-Overall length and width. Graco could have shaved about 4 inches of the length and width. With that being done it would make it much easier to handle in tight areas.

Modifications:
Since it is shaped like a B.O.B. some items fit. We added the items below and LOVE how they made the Trekko a perfect stroller for an outdoor family.

B.O.B Wind protector single - hooks onto the from wheel and the straps to hold in the carseat allow for the sides to be tightened up. We did had two pieces of velco to allow the top straps of the wind protector to be attached to the stroller canopy. Our daughter no longer has to worry about cold walks to day care in 15 degree weather. Keeps her nice and warm when combined with normal cold weather stroller items.
BOB Weather Shield For Single Revolution/Stroller Strides Models in Gray

Handle Tray- This is the same vendor that makes them for B.O.B. the center zippered pouch is huge and holds a large nalgene bottle without issue.Colors of logo are grey so it does not stand out much at all. Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer

Reflective tape-  Added two long strips of silver reflective tape along the side rails as Grace has zero areas of reflectors on it and we often go for early morning and late evening walks.BOB Weather Shield For Single Revolution/Stroller Strides Models in Gray                 Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&nbsp;           Was this review helpful to you?&nbsp; Yes   No                 Report abuse    |  Permalink Comment  &nbsp;Comment

 (REAL NAME)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)                         This review is from:  Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis (Baby Product)         After my call with a supervisor from Graco I came to find out, the video that Amazon has up is NOT the same stroller that's being sold in the US, it's the european model. The Trekko came out in Europe first and there are some key features they did not want to included on the US model for whatever reasons.
This stroller doesn't even have shocks or suspensions so I emailed & asked how can this be a TRUE all terrain stroller. My reply was "No, The wheels do not have shock absorbers. Please lock wheels". But even when they were lock you could still feel them wobble.

-CONS-
For NOT being a jogging stroller (in manuel-reads-not to be used for jogging) it's VERY bulky.
The material doesn't seem like the breathable kind , which means your child will be uncomfortable.
Yes, it's heavy but not much of a difference compare to Jeep's line of strollers.
The mechanism to drop the basket up & down is very poorly made.
Front wheel wobbles even when in lock mode, it's fine when your walking at a slow pace but brisk walking is a no go.
There is this huge gap between the push handle and stroller itself.
Weak amount of cushion and seatback is hard...................
On the bumper bar there is the metal piece with a bolt/screw that just sticks out. NOT safe, if you go over a bump your child could hit it or if they like to rest thier feet on the bar they will surely scrap the skin off. On the video (Europe model) it shows this padded flap piece to cover it up. Graco claims its expose for the carseat, well if you order the travel system version I can see how ideal that will be but if your child will not be in a carseat I don't see how that can be safe. Yes some can throw tape over it or what not but the point is, you shouldn't have to.
AND you all already know the con about no kids tray or cup holder.

-PROS-
Sleek design
The seat sits upright and is higher up then most strollers which is one of the reasons I wanted it. Going over gravel or a walk after the rain meant debris wouldn't be spit up from the wheels into my child's face.
Lever for the seat recline is nice-no draw strings unlike others
I like that the canopy has a huge mesh peek a boo window just right, so when you have the shade all the way down, your child can still see the world without feeling like he/she is in the dark.

-Overall-
I wish the cons didn't outweight the pros and that the stroller would of had an adjustable footrest along with at least a snack tray for the little ones.
If the stroller was maybe under $90 I would of did some tweaking to it and kept it.                 Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&nbsp;           Was this review helpful to you?&nbsp; Yes   No                 Report abuse    |  Permalink Comment  &nbsp;Comments (6)

We were mislead by the 3 wheel appearance which is similar to jogging strollers and some discussions online about the all terrain capability. Come to find out 6 months later that the all terrain was on the European model not the US model. When I contacted Graco, they confirmed that the stroller was for sidewalk walking only. I tried jogging with it anyway and quickly realized it was much too bumpy and rattled too much at the faster speed. It also is very bumpy on anything but the smoothest sidewalks. The stroller is very large and difficult to use in most indoor spaces like stores, restaurants and doctor's offices. There really is no padding to speak of in the seat and there is no cup holder. The few positives are the large basket underneath, the easy open and close features, the large 180 canopy and the window to look into the stroller when pushing. I will be buying a BOB soon for jogging and probably an umbrella stroller for trips out with the baby which I wish I had done to start with.

Additional info:

My daughter is now 10 months and I've started putting her directly into the stroller rather than in her infant seat clicked to the stroller.  Again I find the design of the stroller very poor.  The seat has four recline positions going from fully reclined to fully upright.  Unless I put the seat in the fully upright position, my daughter is leaned back at an uncomfortable incline and strains to pull herself to a sitting position.  But with the seat fully upright, she sits so far forward that the canopy no longer offers any shade unless the sun is behind her.  In other strollers the seat is recessed so that the canopy can come over the top of the baby's head but not for this stroller in the position I described.

Now that she is outgrowing her infant seat and we don't need the stroller to snap the seat into anymore I will be putting this stroller up for sale on Craigslist and using my BOB as my every day stroller.

When used in conjunction with myGraco Snugride 35 Infant Car Seat, Rittenhouse canopy, I get 100% coverage of my little guy. That's important because my son is only 8 weeks old today and his sensitive skin needs to be protected from the sun. The bottom basket is huge and I can easily access my purse in the basket. It collapses easily, almost as easily as my Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Single Stroller, Stone/Black. You might wonder why I have a Trekko if I also have a BJCM. The Trekko handles gravel and trails much better than my BJCM. I got this stroller on another site for less than $100.

Negatives: I wouldn't have paid more than $100 for it now that I've used it. It is HEAVY so it's not my everyday stroller. I keep it in the garage or in my husband's car so he can handle the heavy lifting. It takes up a LOT of space in the trunk of his 2010 Dodge Charger. It doesn't have a parent console which I get around by attaching my Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Blackbag with shuttle clips and eventually I'll attach the Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black. I can't comment on the lack of a snack tray. Both the lack of a snack tray and parent console are similar to that of my BJCM.

Overall, I like this stroller, but I don't love it. It's too big for everyday but it's great for walks on gravel and trails especially when I can get my husband to do the lifting.

My daughter loves it as well.  I love the fact that it reclines all the way and the bottom flap flips up so my baby girls legs don't hang over.  We also have the snug ride 30 car seat, but we barely use the car seat attachment as she hates being confined in her seat.  She does however, love riding in the stroller.  I have been using this (reclined with the bottom flap up) since she was 3 weeks old.

It is a bit bulky when it folds up and it is not a true jogging stroller.  But for around town, walking in our neighborhood, and grocery trips this stroller rocks!  It's sturdy and I absolutely love the 180 degree shade!  Did I mention I LOVE this stroller...

This review is from:  Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis (Baby Product)         When I found out that I was expecting, I began researching all the baby products I wanted.  When it came to strollers I knew I wanted a 3 wheel stroller as they are more maneuverable.  I watched a video review of this stroller and decided that it was the one I wanted.  It was a bit pricey (almost as much as my crib!) but I figured it'd be worth the money.  And it sorta is.

The things I love about it: it is so easy to push.  I can push it with one hand and even turn it with one hand.  It folds down easily.  I love the multiple seating positions.  My son is now 3 months old, so I've mostly used the laying down/flat position.  Now that he getting more control I've been able to raise it into a recline position so he can see out.  I like how there is a flap at the end to keep him safely inside when its in the flat position.  In fact, before I got my crib my son slept in the stroller (don't judge).  It worked great.  :D I love how the seat is cushioned so its comfortable and the straps are padded so its comfortable on his shoulders.  The straps are also easy to buckle.  I love the big basket at the bottom.  I live across the street from Target and am able to just take the stroller and carry my shopping bags in the basket on my way home.  I like that my Graco car seat can also snap in, though honestly I haven't used this feature.  I'm not sure I ever will but its nice to have the option.

Things I don't love quite as much: the size.  Even when it is folded down it takes up most of my trunk space in my Honda Civic.  I haven't had the need yet to take it anywhere (because any long walking we use our infant carrier) but I'm worried about the size when I do. Also, I live on the 3rd floor so it is tricky getting it up and down the stairs.  It isn't heavy per say but it is big and awkward.  it takes two hands and I cant do that while holding a baby.  So when I want to take it out I have to have someone help me or stay in with the baby while I take it down. I also wasn't a huge fan of the price.  Like I said, it was almost as much as my crib.  Once I have another baby I'll have to get rid of it for a double and I'm wondering if it will be worth it.  Though it is pretty fancy, so the price is understandable.

Overall, I love this stroller.  I love the way it feels when I push it.  It is like a hot knife through butter ;) I wish it weren't so big, but what can you do? If you are an avid jogger, you'll like this stroller.

This review is from:  Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis (Baby Product)         I usually love Graco strollers, generally they are well priced, sturdy and comfortable, usually lasting for a long time.  The things I liked about this stroller were: the full recline, the foot rest that folds up to enclose the stroller for use with infants (I like to put a blanket down and use it as a bassinet), I also like the large canopy that rotates and that our graco carseat snaps on.  I really like the idea of the basket that moves up and down but ultimately  it ended up being a big reason for returning the product, its just not made well, it barely latches when in the up position and locks the wheels in the down position.  After less then a week of use it was not working properly, one side would come down while the other was stuck and then you couldn't get the other side back up.  I ended up waking my sleeping baby trying to get my wallet from the diaper bag.  So that was pretty annoying.  The stroller maneuvers pretty well, although the front wheel would occasionally stick.  It folds up very easily, and the front wheel comes off very easily as well making it not too bad to put in our van.  For being a 3 wheel stroller the size isn't too bad but I did find it awkward in the store with the wide wheel base.  We previously had a jeep all terrain stroller for my older daughter which we loved, I would definitely suggest it over this one although its a little more expensive and maybe not quite as &#34;plush&#34;.  We have replaced this with the kolcraft contours stroller, which so far seems really good except the canopy isn't as big and doesn't rotate :( Still searching for that perfect stroller!!
