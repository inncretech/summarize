3.0 out of 5 stars             Disappointed, January 7, 2013                        By&nbsp;Mark Slobbe   - See all my reviews                       Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)                         This review is from:  Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Camera)         I bought this camera after reading hundreds of reviews of camera's in this price range. I've been an avid Canon point and shoot user and I actually can make better pictures with my old Ixus 75 then with this one. It doesn't do well with bright backgrounds (skies, sun) and colours are somewhat bleak too. I've been fooling around with the settings and am slowly getting more vivid pictures where contrast and brightness in fore and background is more balanced. The fact that you can take out the display makes it very handy for video and photography from odd angles. The AF is very fast, but too slow in Live view. I'm considering to sell and get the T4 or better or even switch to Nikon.

5.0 out of 5 stars             Nice SLR!, January 7, 2013                        By&nbsp;awpjack   - See all my reviews                       Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)                         This review is from:  Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Camera)         I was going to buy a SLR because I had a SONY WX9. The WX9 was nice but the photo looks not good in the computer. Because the pixel is 16mp, but the component is small. I did some research before I got this SLR.I compared Canon T3i with Nikon D5100 and D5200. I also compared T2i, T3 and T4i. I found the T3i is the best. You'd better not focus on the pixel. Pixel means nothing. Especially for the new SLR users and the basic SLRs camera. 18MP is much enough for new user like me. Although many people said T3i didn't have many updates from T2i. But I saw many photos from the Flickr which were taken by the T3i. I think the price is nice. I got this camera with the basic lens, 50mm-250mm lens, 16GB Class 10 SD card and an amazon brand camera bag for $690. What a amazing price is. So, if you are a new SLR user like me, and you don't have a lot of money. This one is your chose.

5.0 out of 5 stars             Excellent image quality, great selection of lenses., January 5, 2013                        By&nbsp;TngL "to"  (Gaborone, Botswana, Africa)  - See all my reviews                       This review is from:  Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Camera)         This camera was my first DSLR and I love it! The image quality is absolutely phenomenal (love the bokeh). Most importantly of all, is the selection of lenses that Canon offers. There is a lense for any occasion and they will all take phenomenal pictures. There are many great features packed in the camera and the only slight oddity is the video mode. I find it a little superficial and don't like the focussing modes. But other than that, this is a fantastic camera for taking pictures. If you are looking to buy a DSLR camera for the first time... any Canon Txi series will be an excellent choice. Then later, when you've built up your lenses you can switch to a better body if desired.

5.0 out of 5 stars             Great camera, awesome upgrade from a XSI, January 5, 2013                        By&nbsp;Somedude "Computer consultants Boston"  (Boston MA)  - See all my reviews                       This review is from:  Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Camera)         Started off with a XSI last summer just to play around with and decided to upgrade to a newer camera. The t3i fit the price right and had  a boat load of new features. One of the things I really like is the flip screen (I know some people hate it), but using it with video is just so useful especially when you are at a concert and have to raise the camera above your head (hey how else are you going to get the shot?!)

haha over all , 5 stars! Love this camera                 Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&nbsp;           Was this review helpful to you?&nbsp; Yes   No                 Report abuse    |  Permalink Comment  &nbsp;Comment

Just a little slow, January 5, 2013                        By&nbsp;Nicole Carr   - See all my reviews                       Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)                         This review is from:  Canon EOS Rebel T3i 18 MP CMOS Digital SLR Camera and DIGIC 4 Imaging with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens (Camera)         I had to return this camera because it came defective; however, that was not the reason why I didn't return it for the same thing.  Canon makes great cameras and I chose them over Nikon after doing exhausting research.  The clarity of the pics were amazing.  The only hard issue I had with this camera was the speed.  If you are looking to take rapid pics, this is not your camera.  This is my first DSLR and even I thought it was slow.  After doing more research I found out that if I paid $40 more, I could get the T4.  Why wouldn't I do that?  The T4 is faster, it has more MPs, it has a touch screen, and it can hold two memory cards.  It has in camera HDR and video autofocus.  Now when it originally came out the price was much higher and the T3 was a better bang for your buck, but ever since the price of the T4 came down, it makes no sense to to get the T3.
