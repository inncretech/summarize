 (VINE VOICE)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (TOP 500 REVIEWER)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (REAL NAME)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)                       Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program  (What's this?)          I am a Vine reviewer, and often receive products before their release to the public.  This Bose Solo TV Sound System is one of these products.

I received this sound system with no knowledge of what it really is.  No expectations, except that it a Bose product, so I had an expectation that it'd be quality.

Upon receipt, the unit did not work properly.  I contacted Bose directly and they were AMAZING.  They immediately sent me out a new one, and explained that the product is still in beta-testing.  (They were surprised that I received the product so early before its release.)  I sent back the old one, and they told me that it had old software on it (pre-release).  No worries on it being in the official-product.  The second one had the same problem (since they sent out the second before they got the first back, they didn't realize that the stock was of old software).  No problem--Bose sent out another.  The rep that I worked with (they assign you one person to talk to--a real, live person who emails you back immediately if you have a question) was GREAT.  He checked on me to be sure it was working properly, and answered all questions I had promptly.

So, for customer service, Bose ROCKS!  I would have no problem doing business with them in the future, knowing that they care this much about making things right.

(This is as opposed to a review I did for LG, where they couldn't care less when their product had failures--they were going to charge me to even check it out...even when I told them that I am a Vine reviewer and their customer service would be on my review...some companies couldn't care less.)

So, to the details of my system:

I have an LG 3D HDTV (http://www.amazon.com/LG-55LM7600-55-Inch-LED-LCD-Glasses/dp/B006ZH0M9Q/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1345651587&sr=8-4&keywords=lg+55+inch+hdtv) and run a Sony Blue Ray Player (http://www.amazon.com/Sony-BDP-S590-Blue-ray-Player-Built/dp/B0081SJP7W/ref=sr_1_7?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1345651686&sr=1-7&keywords=3d+blu+ray+player+sony).  I use low-loss optical audio cables (http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Digital-Optical-Audio-Toslink/dp/B001TH7GSW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1345651814&sr=8-1&keywords=optical+audio+cable+amazon).

The set up was simple.  Plug it into the wall outlet, plug it into the tv (use the optical audio!)...well, lah.  It's ready.  If your tv needs a manual change to the external audio, be sure you know where that is.  My tv had an automatic switch to any external audio outlet.  I had to do nothing to switch it.

I have run this speaker through all sorts of testing.  News programs, Movies, Music stations, using all sorts of sound bands.

Here's what I found:

Speech:  (This is my favorite part of the speaker, and deserves lots of attention.)  I have a hearing problem in that I have trouble understanding speech coming from television speakers.  My television has an option that amps up the voice, which I thought helped a lot...until I plugged in this Bose speaker.  Suddenly, the voices were crisp and clear!  It was clearer than "life", in my opinion.  I believe that this is the best feature of this speaker...When I compared it to the sound from the tv (with the voice-feature turned on) it was night and day.  (And here I thought that it was so good with the voice feature from the tv...not so much, now.)

Comedy (with canned-laughter):  As I said earlier, the speech is clear, and the balance is such that the canned-laughter is not overpowering.  Great quality, especially when you compare it to the tv's internal speaker.

Movies (with lots of bass--bombs, car chases, etc):  The speech is great (have I mentioned that before?  haha) but the lower end seems to be lacking a bit.  Not in comparison with the tv.  The tv didn't get it, either...but compared to the separate receiver and subwoofer, it does lack in the bass range.  I didn't notice this as much as the people watching with me...yeah, it was the guys--they like that bomb-stuff  :)

Music:  Same issue as the movies.  Music channels, like XM or Sirius, have a great lack in bass.  The music crispness and treble are great--but the bass is lacking.  Obviously, you don't want to make your tv the primary outsource for your music enjoyment, but this deserves to be noted.  Again, comparing it side-by-side with the tv, the sound is spectacular (but both lack the bass of the receiver).

Pros:  Voice, clarity, real-life feel to all sounds.  Simplicity of set up and use.  Simple remote control (has only 3 buttons--Power, Volume Up, Volume Down).  Looks nice on the table...but this is also a "con".
Cons:  Lack of ability to change settings on bass/treble.  Big box on the table instead of a wall mount.

So--the bottom line is this:  If you are using this speaker as it is intended, which is to replace your tv's internal speaker, then it's AMAZING.  If you think it will be a replacement for all of your outlets, including music listening, you might be disappointed.

Although I have a nice Sony Bravia TV, the sound can be a little...disappointing.  This is especially noticeable when we watch BluRay versions of movies like "A Bridge Too Far" or "The Battle of Britan" - the TV begins to vibrate and buzz when the planes fly over.  However, not being an overall audiophile, I had no desire to install a surround sound system with five speakers.  I was looking into getting a sound bar when I discovered the Bose Solo TV Sound System.

The Bose Solo is a single box, roughly the size of a standard DVD / BluRay player; the dimensions are 10.25" x 20"; the TV is placed on top of the Bose Solo.  Not having to find additional shelf or floor space for the speaker is definitely a plus!  According to the package, this is designed for TVs up to 32" and in some cases up to 42".  The base of the TV must not overhang the Bose Solo, or else the TV may be unstable and fall.  However, the base of my 46" TV fits on top of the speaker box with room to spare.

There is a very small, thin, flat remote control that comes with the Bose Solo - ON, UP, DOWN, PAUSE/OFF.  According to the Operating Guide the unit can be operated with a Universal Remote as well.  But since I don't have a Universal Remote, I will have to add another remote to the growing collection on the coffee table.

Hooking up the Bose Solo was simple once I located the corresponding jack on the back of the TV.  There are only two connections to make - 1) the power cord, and 2) either the analog (red and white jacks) or optical digital audio cable.  The optical digital cable is recommended for best sound quality, so I wanted to use that - but had no previous experience with this type of cable.  The ends of the optical digital cables have protective plastic shields which must be removed before installation, and they are fairly small.  It took me some time to find the optical digital cable jack on the back of my TV.  I was finally able to locate it when I turned off some of the lights in the room, and then I saw the red light coming from the optical jack!  The connections on the back of the Bose Solo are well labeled and easy to find.

Once the TV and the Bose Solo were connected, I turned on the new box and heard some kind of distorted sound echo.  A quick trip to the troubleshooting FAQ in the operating guide informed me that the TV sound should either be disabled or the volume turned all the way down.  Once I disabled the TV sound, the sound coming from the Bose Solo took over.

My personal testing included turning the Bose up to full volume.  The sound filled the room and in fact could be heard quite nicely from other rooms, too.  I put in my go to BluRay, "The Battle of Britan" - no distortion, no vibration, no hum.  (The lack of vibration is even more impressive when you consider this rather large TV is balanced on the speaker itself!)  I also listened to music from classical to metal and everything sounded beautiful!  I then went back and forth between the sound from the Bose Solo and the sound from the Sony Bravia only - the Bose definitely has a richer sound with more bass; the TV now sounds a bit tinny by comparison.  The TV volume can be cranked up higher, but the higher it goes the more distortion and vibration come through - the Bose certainly cranks up high enough to fill a room (and possibly the entire house) and there is no distortion.  Although the Bose instructions explicitly state that the TV volume should be OFF,  I also experimented with the Bose Solo and bringing up the TV volume to just under the point where echo kicks in, and thought that sounded great, too!

The bottom line is that while the Bose Solo won't take the place of Surround Sound, it greatly improves the experience of watching TV and movies with a richer sound quality than the TV alone and no distortion or vibration.  Since it's a single box that fits under the TV base, it doesn't take up additional space on the shelf or floor.  It's very easy to install - add the power cable to the wall and the audio cable to the TV, and you're done!

Highly recommended!                 Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&nbsp;           Was this review helpful to you?&nbsp; Yes   No                 Report abuse    |  Permalink Comment  &nbsp;Comments (3)

 (VINE VOICE)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (TOP 1000 REVIEWER)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (REAL NAME)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)                       Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program  (What's this?)          This is a great device to add to a room with a HDTV, but where you don't want to install a full surround sound system.  For me, I have a main television with surround sound in the Living Room, but also have a television in the bedroom.  I don't want to install a full surround sound system in here, but also don't like the tinny sound of the television's audio.  The Bose SOLO is a perfect solution.

The sound is fantastic...just as you would expect from Bose.  I was surprised at how much the sounds reflected around the room, sounding exactly like surround sound even though the unit is place beneath my television.  I love the audio!  What I don't like is that there is no way to connect the audio controls with the television remote, meaning I have to use two remotes.  Also, there is no power button on the main unit itself, so you have to use the remote for this purpose.  This is typically no problem, except for the fact that this morning the unit would not power on through the remote.  I had to unplug it from the back power supply, and plug it back in to turn on.  If this happens again I will notate here on Amazon.

I say that because the room presents acoustic challenges. The Bose Solo TV Speaker system was up to the task. Virtually, wherever I am standing in the room, the sound from the speaker is clear and distinct. It is better to hook up the audio source using the digital optical connector (cable included) rather then the RCA analog stereo connector (also included). The better clarity is noticeable. The other great feature about this speaker is that you get a balanced sound at many volume levels. The base, treble, and mid-level sounds maintain proportionality whether you are listening quietly late at night or early in the morning or if you need to crank it up during the day. There is also sufficient separation to know that you are listening to a stereo source.

My one criticism is that it seems that you cannot hook up one device to the digital optical input and at the same time use the analog input for another device. This means you have to run everything into the TV and use its output to link to the speaker. This may not always be convenient in every setup.

Regardless, qualitatively, you can't go wrong upgrading from the speaker built-in to the TV or upgrading from a setup that isn't quite dealing with room acoustics. This product is well-designed and lets you hear more from the source. Also, from a space saving perspective, it's great that you can mount the TV right on top of it.

Those action movies, sports events, and music channels are going to be more enjoyable with the Bose Solo. Have fun!

I set it up before I read about the weight limit. I don't think this will be a problem. Like almost everyone else I bought it because flat panel speakers are terrible. The Bose Solo sound is adequate, nothing more. Wiring is kept to a minimum.  The lack of controls directly on the box is going to be a problem. I am sure I will lose hours of my life looking for that remote. Can't get my Uverse remote to work with it. Bose offers their own universal remote but come on, this speaker has only 4 functions. It should work with all remotes. It sounds the same as my wave radio except it has less functionality. Priced above what it is worth but not having to mount a sound bar and place a subwoofer is why I am going to live with the trade offs.

47 of 49 people found the following review helpful                       5.0 out of 5 stars             Bose Rocks! WOW! Incredible sound and super easy setup!, September 12, 2012                        By&nbsp;Gadget Queen "Gadget Queen"   - See all my reviews                       This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)         I was skeptical at first, but ordered the solo anyway (directly from Bose, same price as Amazon, but financing available). I was pleasantly surprised and amazed! Having been actively looking for a home theater system for some time, I was delighted with the solo sound system. What I experienced was NO BASS DISTORTION WHATSOEVER! Full, even-bodied sound. Highs not too high, lows just right, sound clarity amazing, and room-filling sound.

After the easy connection and turning the unit on (and turning my TV speakers off), the solo tv sound system made my TV sound so realistic it literally brought me out of my chair! From the first moment the solo was turned on, I was immersed in music (classical DirectTV channel) to the point I could distinguish between violins and violas (not easy when listening on regular TV speakers). The highs were crisp and the bass was not overpowering so as to vibrate the entire room (and distort the sound). Everything was crisp, vibrant, full-toned, well-balanced, and a pleasure to listen to! TV shows were even better! Dialog was clearer than with the regular TV speakers, and the system added a real depth to the TV watching experience. DEFINITELY worth the price! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!! I kept switching between the TV speakers and the solo to get a comparison, and there is NO comparison! The Solo is an excellent system!

As a consumer, I wanted a home theater system, but did not want the high expense and all the extra boxes for the extra speakers all over the room. Nor did I want the wires or the wireless setup. When I set up the solo it was only 2 connections: to the electricity and to the television. Boom, done, finis. It can't get any easlier or simpler than that! The price was just right, and compared to other systems listed at much higher prices, the sound was either equal to or surpassed what I had heard before from those other systems (which, obviously, I did not purchase).

I have owned other Bose products over the years (Bose Wave, Bose iPod Travel Speaker, Bose home stereo speakers), and the quality is ALWAYS top-notch! Same for their Customer Service. The Solo is a fine addition to an already great product line-up by Bose. They really know sound quality! Congratulations Bose! You have a real winner with this sound system!

GET THIS SYSTEM. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! For me, it was love at first sound!                 Help other customers find the most helpful reviews&nbsp;           Was this review helpful to you?&nbsp; Yes   No                 Report abuse    |  Permalink Comment  &nbsp;Comment (1)

Peplinski  (Michigan)  - See all my reviews
 (VINE VOICE)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (REAL NAME)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)                       Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program  (What's this?)          The prices of flat panel LCD and plasma televisions of all sizes have really diminished over the past decade.  Unfortunately, what has also diminished is the sound quality from the built-in TV speakers.  While there already exists a market and product line for most home theatre sound systems--either as component systems, home theatre in a box set ups, or soundbar systems--most of these typically service your main TV that is 42" or larger.  The best way to think of the Bose Solo TV system is as a soundbar for TVs 32" and smaller.  It is designed to have your flat panel TV sit on top, although it can be placed anywhere--on a separate shelf, next to the TV, wherever, as long as you have cables that reach.  The sound quality is top notch--what you would expect from Bose.  I was very impressed with the amount of bass it put out, especially considering its size.  It wasn't quite the amount you would get from a separate powered subwoofer, but it was leaps and bounds better than the TV's speakers.  There was also excellent balance of range particularly at the low and mid ranges.  The high range seemed slightly muted, but perhaps that is just because I'm so used to the low quality, tinny, treble that we get from the TV speakers.  Either way, it was a substantial improvement in sound quality that really fills the room.  The remote is simple and easy to use with four buttons: Power, volume up/down, and mute.  I also liked the soft rubberized feel of the buttons.  It would have been better if the volume up/down were slightly angled and maybe a different shape, so you could easily know which button you were pressing in the dark.

I did have trouble getting the optical cable to connect and stay seated at first.  I tried using another cable I already owned and it still wasn't working.  I heeded the advice of the manufacturer in the comments and called into their customer service line.  I don't know why, but for some reason I just could not get the cable to stay seated initially, but when I tried it again after calling them, it worked (and yes, I had already removed the little rubber covers).  I think the issue was that the door to the optical input is seated a few millimeters behind a plate and I have a fat "handle" to my optical cable which was getting hung up on that plate.  If you use the cable supplied, it should not be an issue.  Calling their customer service line was a pleasant experience as well.  I had minimal hold time (approximately 2 minutes) and the representative was helpful and easily understood.

47 of 53 people found the following review helpful                       5.0 out of 5 stars             Really great option for a TV in a small room, August 14, 2012                        By&nbsp;Doc Stew  (Elburn, IL)  - See all my reviews
 (VINE VOICE)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)                       Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program  (What's this?)          At the time of this writing, this product has not been released. Therefore, I do not know the exact specs of the speakers, nor do I even know the MSRP. What I can tell you is how good this little unit sounds!

This is a single unit that measures 21" X 12" X 3". It is intended to have a TV 42" or smaller sit directly on top of it. The inputs it has on the back of the unit are optical, coax, and analog (red/white connectors). There are NO HDMI connections available.

This unit is NOT intended to be a receiver, like some other sound bars. You cannot plug all of your devices (TV, DVR, blu-ray player, etc) into this device, as this is not made for that. It is made to run the audio OUT from your TV to the audio IN on the Bose. That is it.

I tried plugging my DVR optical out into the optical in on the Bose, and it did NOT work. I thought I had a defective unit. I have my TV mounted high on the wall with wires hidden in the wall, so I had to buy a long optical cable and run it through the wall. I connected it to my TVs optical audio out to the Bose's optical audio in, and it worked. I shut the speakers off on my TV, and let the Bose take over the sound.

The sound is FAR superior to any TV's built in speakers. It simply doesn't even compare. The bass is fantastic - not too strong, but just enough to grab your attention. The highs are crisp and dialogue sounds fantastic. I feel like I hear a LOT more details than just listening through my TVs speakers. It gets moderately loud, but at full volume, it's only enough to fill a small to medium sized room. I have this hooked up to the TV in our bedroom, which is 20' x 25', and it suits it well.

Personally, I would not use this for a large family room, as it's simply not powerful enough. But I'm an audio enthusiast, and I have a full 5.1 setup for our family room. Some people just want the simplicity of something small that sounds better than their TV speakers. If you're one of those people, you should really consider this unit. But again, it's made to support TVs 42" or smaller, so keep that in mind. If you have a 60" TV that is not wall mounted, you may want to consider other options.

The unit comes with a 6' very thin, cheap optical cable, a coax cable, and red/white audio cables. It comes with a small, VERY basic remote. The remote has: power, volume up, volume down, and mute. That is it.

I use a Logitech Harmony remote in our bedroom, and had no problem setting this up. Even though the Bose isn't even listed in the Harmony database (again, at the time of this writing, the Bose hasn't even been listed on the Bose website), I still made it work. Just go to add a device, amplifier ---> amplifier, and type in Bose and the name. It won't recognize the name, and that's OK. Take your little Bose remote and point it at your Harmony remote, and have the Harmony "learn" the IR commands from the Bose. I just programmed the Harmony to recognize the 4 buttons on the Bose remote, and voila - no need to use the Bose remote! Easy as pie.

All in all, this is a very good sounding unit, and far exceeds any TVs built in speakers. The improvement in dialogue alone is worth the price of admission.

ADDENDUM 9/4/12: like someone else mentioned on here, my unit had an issue that it would not power on. I had to remove the AC adapter from the back and plug it back in, then it worked again. I will keep updating this as time goes on. But I'm still VERY happy with this unit!

 (VINE VOICE)   &nbsp;&nbsp; (REAL NAME)   &nbsp;&nbsp;                          This review is from:  Bose® Solo TV Sound System (Electronics)                       Customer review from the Amazon Vine&#8482; Program  (What's this?)          The Bose Solo TV sound system is an excellent addition to any home entertainment system. The sound quality is clear and powerful enough to change my whole TV experience.

My first impressions were that Bose took the time and effort into packaging the system (something which I've only really seen with Apple products to date personally). The product packaging securely kept the device from getting hurt during the shipping process and made it exciting to get the system out and setup for the television. The instructions even helped me understand something that I really should have figured out a long time ago -- the things at the end of optical cable are just caps that you're supposed to remove. As someone who never used optical cables previously reading through the instructions made things a little easier for me (not used to removing caps from cables).

In terms of the sound I'm shocked by the difference between it and my tv speakers. To see what sort of difference actually existed I tested muting my television speakers and the Bose Solo TV sound system one by one to compare it... it really doesn't compare. It just feels alive while my television speakers just kind of deliver sound... I'm not a guy audio guy so I won't be able to give a good idea of why it's great I just know it is.

The controller that comes with the system is sufficient although kind of tiny and I imagine it'll get lost sometime in the next few months. It only has a few buttons, however, because the system isn't that complex to control so I imagine that's very intentional. Either way the system was really easy to get into my universal remote so I no longer even need the little thing but I can imagine people who lack a universal remote may be annoyed at home many controllers they'll have after this (cable, tv, bluray, bose) but that's not really Bose's fault.

In general I'd highly recommend this product the sound quality is amazing and it really changes how I watch television into more of an experience than it was prior.
